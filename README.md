## ðŸ“Œ Lab 5.1 â€“ Feature Engineering: Calendric and Peak Hours Inclusion

### ðŸŽ¯ Objective
Enhance dataset quality by extracting meaningful time-based features such as calendar attributes (day, month, weekend) and peak hour indicators, to improve predictive modeling.

---

### ðŸ“– Introduction
Feature engineering allows us to enrich raw data, enabling machine learning models to learn better from hidden patterns. Time-based features are particularly useful in domains like:

- Energy usage analysis
- Traffic modeling
- Retail forecasting

---

### ðŸ›  Tools Used
- **Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** `pandas`, `numpy`, `datetime`  
- **Platform:** Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab  

---# ðŸ“Š Lab 5.2 â€“ AEP_Correlation

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
Analyze the correlation between AEP (Annual or Average Energy Production) and various features to identify the most influential variables.

---

## ðŸ“– Introduction
Correlation analysis helps us understand how features are linearly related to each other. This is critical for feature selection in predictive modeling, particularly in energy analytics and forecasting tasks.

Understanding the relationships between input features and the target variable (AEP) allows us to:

- Remove irrelevant or redundant features  
- Focus on strong predictors  
- Improve model performance and reduce overfitting

## ðŸ›  Tools Used
- **Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** `pandas`, `seaborn`, `matplotlib`**
